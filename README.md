## About ##

This extension checks the [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) [API](https://developer.forecast.io/) for the weather at your current location (using your IP address) providing you with the current temperature, conditions, and what to expect for the next hour and the next 24 hours.

## Configure ##

No configuration is needed since the extension automatically looks up the weather based on your current location using your IP address. To over-ride automatic location lookup, [look up the coordinates](http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php) for your address and enter them as `SET_LAT` and `SET_LON` in the workflow settings.

## Install ##

Download or clone the directory and place it in `~/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2/Alfred.alfredpreferences/workflows` or [download the worfklow package](http://cl.ly/3l213I273h0r) and double click to install.
